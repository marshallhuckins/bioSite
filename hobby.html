            <p>Linda's love of Christmas was ignited during her childhood visits to the Brandeis building, where the enchanting holiday displays captured her imagination. Each year, the store was transformed into a festive wonderland, with every inch adorned with wreaths, garlands, and Christmas trees. The second floor, where Santa awaited, featured an array of toys and a large train moving around the store, creating a magical experience reminiscent of "Miracle on 34th Street." These visits, often shared with both her parents in the evenings, became Linda's most cherished childhood memories.</p>
            <p>As Linda grew older, her passion for Christmas and its decorations only intensified. The joy and wonder she experienced at Brandeis inspired her to dream of one day opening her own Christmas store. This dream fueled her love for the holiday season and motivated her to start her own collection of Santa figurines while working at Brandeis in Council Bluffs.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Linda's collection and enthusiasm for Christmas have continued to grow. Her home transforms into a holiday spectacle each year, filled with the warmth and magic she experienced as a child. Through her decorations and traditions, Linda keeps the spirit of those magical Brandeis Christmases alive, sharing the joy and wonder of the season with her family and friends.</p>
